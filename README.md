# Maritime-simulator001
Scenario: SC001 – Night Collision Avoidance
Author: cmamanish29
Platform: Web-based (accessible via browser, mobile-friendly)

🌊 Overview

This project recreates a virtual maritime simulator focused on collision avoidance during night navigation. It replicates bridge and radar views from a vessel’s perspective, allowing users to interact with navigation elements such as bearing, speed, and light recognition — without needing physical simulator hardware.

🎯 Objectives

Provide immersive Deck-side training for maritime learners.

Recreate real-world COLREG-compliant navigation scenarios.

Enable AI-assisted debriefing via future integration with Jotform AI or Glide-based knowledge agent.

Serve as an interactive training aid accessible from any device.

🖥️ Features

Dual perspective views:

🧭 Bridge View: Vessel’s external and light-based environment.

📡 Radar View: Real-time situational awareness with distance and heading info.

Interactive commands for:

Speed adjustment

Course alteration

Radar range scaling

Decision logging

Event-based scenario progression (e.g., detecting a vessel crossing, initiating avoidance maneuver).
